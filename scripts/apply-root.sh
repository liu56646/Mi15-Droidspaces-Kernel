# Integrate a root solution (+ optional SUSFS) into a GKI kernel tree.
#
#   ROOT_FLAVOR=ksu-next   -> KernelSU-Next  (no KPM; hooks are built in on v3.x)
#   ROOT_FLAVOR=sukisu     -> SukiSU Ultra   (KPM available, branch `builtin` has SUSFS)
#   ROOT_FLAVOR=none       -> no root (clean kernel, still gets Droidspaces)
#
# Facts this encodes (verified against the upstream repos, see docs/RESEARCH.md):
#  * KernelSU-Next branches are stable/dev/legacy — there is NO `next` branch, and
#    v3.x Kconfig exposes only KSU / KSU_DEBUG / KSU_DISABLE_MANAGER / KSU_DISABLE_POLICY.
#    The old CONFIG_KSU_MANUAL_HOOK / KSU_KPROBES_HOOK选择 no longer exists: v3.x ships
#    kernel/hook/{lsm_hook,syscall_hook,setuid_hook}.c plus a runtime symbol_resolver
#    and needs no fs/*.c edits. CONFIG_KSU depends on KPROBES && EXT4_FS (both =y in stock).
#  * KPM is a SukiSU Ultra feature, not a KernelSU-Next one.
#  * SUSFS lives at gitlab.com/simonpunk/susfs4ksu, branch gki-android15-6.6 (SUSFS v2.3.0).
#    kernel_patches/KernelSU/10_enable_susfs_for_ksu.patch targets the KSU tree
#    (kernel/Kbuild, kernel/hook/*, kernel/supercall/*), while SukiSU's `builtin`
#    branch already defines the KSU_SUSFS* symbols itself and must NOT be patched.

# older layout: it *deletes* hook/lsm_hook.o, hook/syscall_hook_manager.o and
# infra/symbol_resolver.o from kernel/Kbuild, which are exactly the files v3.x is
# built on. KernelSU-Next itself carries no kernel-side SUSFS (only
# userspace/ksud/src/susfsd.rs), so there is nothing to enable either.
